# Add to Cart App

This project was my first attempt at working with Firebase in order to store and manipulate stored data.
I found it to be a very educational project as I learned how to use the following Functions imported from
Firebase:

    -initializeApp
    -getDatabase
    -reference
    -push
    -onValue
    -snapshot

I also learned a few other things outside of my focus on Firebase which was:
        -Using user-select to prevent users from unintentionally selecting parts of the app
        -Adding a Favicon to my app using favicon.io
        -Using and editing parts of the Web Application Manifest file
