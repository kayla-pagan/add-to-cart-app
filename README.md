# Add to Cart App

This project was my first attempt at working with Firebase in order to store and manipulate stored data.
I found it to be a very educational project as I learned how to use the following Functions imported from
Firebase:

  -initializeApp
  -getDatabase
  -reference
  -push
  -onValue
  -snapshot
